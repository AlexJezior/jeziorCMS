[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/AlexJezior/jeziorCMS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/AlexJezior/jeziorCMS)

JeziorCMS is a project I have decided to publish on GitHub while I develop upon it. Anyone is welcome to use this code as they wish, with acknowledgement of all the other services included in this project. 

The intended purpose of this project, is for me to generate a better understanding for the Laravel framework, while creating my first publicly accessible CMS. I encourage any and all feedback, as I feel it will help improve my learning, and future branch experiences. Thanks!


## Updates

<strong>4/23/2017 - </strong> Initial commit of the project. As it currently stands, there is a CMS login/registration at '/jezior-cms'. Upon logging in you will see that you can Add, Edit, and Delete current pages for the front end of the site, also allowing for unique, 100% manageable, permalinks. There is a rough draft for the dynamic loading of the CMS plugin pages; calling for simple CRUD fundamentals. Custom will later need to be required.
